            "roomIntroduction": "Van Gogh developed his decoration of the Yellow House into a concept for the presentation of his work that could stand alongside the paintings of his contemporaries and even be transferred for exhibition in Paris. Throughout his time in Provence, he dispatched his work to his brother in the capital and submitted pictures to exhibitions in Paris and Brussels. Visitors also came to Theo's flat to see Vincent’s work. After Van Gogh’s first mental breakdown at the end of 1888, and subsequent crises in the following spring, during which time he lost possession of the Yellow House, he carried on developing his ideas for the decoration. One of his most famous groupings, devised during the spring of 1889 when he was in Saint-Rémy, is recreated in this room: two Sunflower pictures flanking La Berceuse.",

In a further remove from observation, he invented the foreground hut and sunflowers inspired by a scene in Le Sens de la vie (The Meaning of Life), an 1889 novel by Edouard Rod (1857-1910).",

But in September, he reworked and changed it in the studio to intensify the work's highly textured surface. Although the yellows, pinks and reds, which heightened the colour contrasts throughout, have since degraded and almost disappeared, the picture remains remarkably expressive.",

Here the disc hovers above a grove of highly stylised olive trees. At the time Van Gogh wanted to prove to Gauguin and Bernard that an expressive work of art could be made without quoting directly from the Bible.",

It is exceptionally well preserved in terms of its colour. In other works, such as Olive Grove with Two Olive Pickers (59) hanging alongside, Van Gogh experimented with paints that were new on the market and which have since faded. For this luminous picture he used more stable pigments.",
