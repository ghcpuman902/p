Room 5

Decoration

Van Gogh developed his decoration of

the Yellow House into a concept for the
presentation of his work that could stand
alongside the paintings of his contemporaries,
and even be transferred for exhibition in

Paris. Throughout his time in Provence, he
dispatched his work to his brother in the
capital and submitted pictures to exhibitions
in Paris and Brussels. Visitors also came to
Theo's flat to see Vincent’s work. After Van
Gogh’s first mental breakdown at the end of
1888, and subsequent crises in the following
spring, during which time he lost possession
of the Yellow House, he carried on developing
his ideas for the decoration. One of his most
famous groupings, devised during the spring
of 1889 when he was in Saint-Rémy, is
recreated in this room: two Sunflower
pictures flanking La Berceuse.

The Stevedores, 1888

‘| saw a magnificent and very strange effect
this evening. A very large boat laden with coal
on the Rhéne, moored at the quay... . On the
boat, small workmen... were coming and
going, carrying the cargo ashore. It was pure
Hokusai.’ Van Gogh's description of a scene
that reminded him of the celebrated Japanese
printmaker later resulted in this remarkable
picture. The sunset is captured in orange,
yellow and turquoise streaked with lilac.

The Trinquetaille Bridge, 1888

At Arles, a modern bridge crossed the

Rhéne to connect the old town with the new
Trinquetaille quarter. As in The Stevedores (35),
Van Gogh explores the expressive potential

he could achieve using an observed, modern-
life subject. The plunging perspective and
exaggerated colours, including the river and
sky being ‘the colour of absinthe’, had a specific
aim that he outlined in a letter to his brother:
‘I’m attempting something more heartbroken
and therefore more heartbreaking.’

The Courtyard of the
Hospital at Arles, 1889

In the spring of 1889, Van Gogh spent
extended time in the hospital in Arles, where
he was given a room as a Studio. He painted
when well enough and carried on seeking
ways to imbue observed details with emotion.
‘So it’s a painting chock-full of flowers and
springtime greenery,’ he wrote to his sister,
Willemien (1862-1941). ‘However, three black,
sad tree-trunks cross it like snakes, and in the
foreground four large sad, dark box bushes.’

View of Arles, 1889

The bare trunks of three poplars, cropped by
the edges of the canvas, form a foreground
screen through which the more distant skyline
of Arles and its flowering orchards can be

seen. Van Gogh must have hoped his inventive
combination of daring geometry and rich surface
texture would impress other artists. He sent

the picture to two high-profile, avant-garde
exhibitions in early 1890: the Salon des
Indépendants in Paris and Les XX in Brussels.

Field with Poppies, 1889

In early June 1889, Van Gogh focused on the
landscapes beyond the grounds at Saint-Rémy.
This dense patchwork of fields, in which the
bright reds of poppies catch the eye, was
among the first paintings he made. In what
was now becoming his practice, the work was
only partially painted outdoors. Back in the
studio, Van Gogh adjusted the view to suit

his expressive aims: the two houses were
inserted, the layout of the fields altered,

and the cypresses added.

The Large Plane Trees
(Road Menders at Saint-Remy),
1888

Van Gogh witnessed this scene while walking
through Saint-Rémy in the autumn of 1889.
Inspired to make a painting, he used a piece

of fabric printed with tiny red diamonds (visible
in the rocks, bottom left). Van Gogh made a
second version on traditional canvas, but it was
this picture that he had Theo send to the Salon
des Indépendants exhibition in Paris in 1890.

Portrait of a Peasant
(Patience Escalier), 1888

Van Gogh was convinced he could transform
the likeness of Patience Escalier, an old
gardener he met in Arles, into the image

of a quintessential peasant through his use of
exaggerated colour and the handling of paint.
In a letter to his brother, he compared it to the
way he intended to paint The Poet (3), in which
a deep blue background would express ‘the
infinite’. Here, he used blazing oranges and
glowing gold tones to communicate ‘the very
furnace of harvest time, deep‘in the south’.
The portrait formed part of his decoration.

The loan of this extraordinary work is the
result of a special exchange partnership
between the National Gallery and the
Norton Simon Museum, which most recently
involved the presentation of Picasso Ingres:
Face to Face in 2022.

Sunflowers, 1888

One of the first of the Sunflowers Van Gogh
painted in Arles, this picture was hung in

the guest bedroom of the Yellow House in
preparation for welcoming Paul Gauguin to

his ‘artist's home’. Although the two men
disagreed on many things over the two months
they lived and worked together, Gauguin
greatly admired the Sunflower paintings, and
later wrote to Van Gogh describing them as

a ‘perfect page of an essential “Vincent” style’.

La Berceuse (The Lullaby),
1889

Van Gogh painted Augustine Roulin and her
children on several occasions before creating
this symbolic depiction of her as an ideal of
motherhood, a rope to rock an unseen cradle
in her lap. With a title that could be translated
as The Lullaby, this canvas was one of several
versions, the first of which was begun in
Gauguin’s company in late 1888. Its flattened
areas of colour, bounded by firm outlines, show
Van Gogh contributing new ideas to the latest
artistic developments in Paris.

Sunflowers, 1889

Van Gogh realised the importance of the
Sunflowers and painted additional versions of
them in early 1889, such as this one with its
blue background. Later, in May, he elaborated
a daring new scheme for their display in a
letter to his brother. Describing it as a ‘triptych’
(three-panelled work), he imagined two
Sunflower pictures flanking La Berceuse (43)
which, if hung in a ship, might bring comfort
to sailors travelling far from home.

Oleanders, 1888

In Arles, free-flowering oleanders grew in
profusion in the park Van Gogh designated
‘the poet’s garden’. He associated the plant
with love affairs. The two books placed next
to the vase in this picture include one of Van
Gogh's favourites. This was Emile Zola’s 1884
novel La Joie de Vivre (The Joy of Living), a tale
of optimism in the face of relentless difficulty.

Still Life with Coffee Pot,
1888

In a letter to Emile Bernard, Van Gogh
described this still life as ‘a variation of blues
enlivened by a series of yellows ranging all

the way to orange’. The description barely
does justice to the bold arrangement of forms
and colours and does not mention the highly
conceptual game Van Gogh plays by giving the
work a painted, fictional red inner frame set
within the expanse of white painted canvas.

Variations ona Theme

The landscape surrounding Saint-Rémy,

with its olive groves and the craggy
limestone of the Alpilles mountain range,
provided Van Gogh with rich material for
creating works in series. Developing ideas he
had established in Arles, he fixed on subjects
and explored their expressive possibilities
through variations. At times, he imaginatively
pitched his own work against that produced
by Gauguin and Bernard. Van Gogh now
often created his work in the studio, a room
provided for him at the hospital, which led
him to produce some of the most stylised
art of his career. He also used the studio

to continue creating ‘repetitions’ of existing
works and new portraits.

The Arlésienne, 1890

Oil on canvas
Private collection

In popular culture of the time, the women of
Arles were celebrated for their raven-haired
beauty. Van Gogh painted five versions of this
Arlésienne (woman from Arles). The model,
Marie Ginoux (1848-1911), who ran the local
café, had originally posed for Van Gogh and
Gauguin in November 1888. Later, when in
Saint-Rémy, Van Gogh based his quintessential
Provencale on the simplified lines of a charcoal
drawing Gauguin had made during the sitting.
He added two of his favourite books: Charles
Dickens's Christmas Stories, 1843-8, and
Harriet Beecher Stowe’s now controversial
anti-slavery novel, Uncle Tom’s Cabin, 1852. In
a letter to Gauguin, Van Gogh called the image
‘a synthesis of an Arlésienne’. He presented
one (47) to his friend Emile Bernard, one to
Theo and another to Gauguin himself, thus
ensuring the paintings would be seen by
artists in Paris.

A Wheatfield, with Cypresses,
1889

With swirling and rippling strokes of paint,
Van Gogh captures the summer mistral wind
sweeping through a landscape at the foot

of the Alpilles mountains. He had first made
an outdoor painting of this view in late June
1889. But in this studio version of September,
he stylised the sky to create a decorative
pattern that finds echoes in the mountains,
cypresses and vegetation below.

Landscape with Ploughman,
1889

Van Gogh's view from his room at the
hospital was a wheatfield enclosed by a
wall. By painting it repeatedly, both from
indoors and out, he created a series through
which he tried to capture different moods
and the essence of the Provencal seasons.
The intensity of this autumnal scene in

low sunlight is achieved through the bold
articulation of his brushwork and a radically
simplified and partially invented background.

Landscape at Saint-Remy
(Enclosed Field with Peasant),
1889

Writing to the artist Emile Bernard, Van Gogh
described this scene as ‘nothing but rough
ground and rocks, with a thistle and dry grass in
a corner, and a little violet and yellow man’. To
increase the expressive potential of the image,
Van Gogh chose to emphasise the barren heights
of the Alpilles in the background, which he
painted rising to the top of the picture.

Landscape from Saint-Remy
(Wheatfield behind Saint-Paul
Hospital), 1889

Observing the enclosed field after a storm had
‘ravaged and knocked to the ground’ the crop
of wheat, Van Gogh created this composition

in which a large cloud hovers above the scene.
‘It’s a landscape of extreme simplicity’, he noted
to Theo and, thinking about his decoration,
suggested it would make a good contrasting
pair to his first version of The Bedroom.

The Olive Trees, 1889

When Van Gogh worked beyond the hospital
at Saint-Rémy in early summer 1889, he was
delighted by the olive trees seen against the
Alpilles. They became a focus in his aim to
capture his ‘Impressions of Provence’ — a
series of pictures through which he would
transform reality into an expressive ideal. The
rhythmic stylisation of the earth, trees and
mountains and the form of a massive cloud
above were probably all painted in the studio.

The Olive Trees, 1889

Van Gogh made this drawing after the
painting alongside (53) and chose to push

its abstract, decorative qualities to even
greater heights. The virtuosity of his cursive
and calligraphic use of the quill and reed pen
puts this work on a par with the Montmajour
drawings of the previous summer. Theo van
Gogh, however, was surprised at this direction
in his brother's work and tried to discourage
its further pursuit.

Mountains at Saint-Remy,
1889

Taking an actual view as a starting point but
choosing not to reproduce it faithfully, Van
Gogh painted this highly abstracted landscape
using mobile, heavy outlines that he happily
acknowledged had little to do with nature. In

a further remove from observation, he invented
the foreground hut and sunflowers inspired

by a scene in Le Sens de /a vie (The Meaning

of Life), an 1889 novel by Edouard Rod
(1857-1910).

Olive Trees, 1889

Looking down onto the earth and shadows

cast by a grove of olives, Van Gogh began this
picture working outdoors in June 1889. But in
September, he reworked and changed it in the
studio to intensify the work's highly textured
surface. Although the yellows, pinks and reds,
which heightened the colour contrasts throughout,
have since degraded and almost disappeared,
the picture remains remarkably expressive.

Olive Trees, 1889

The prominent placement of an intensely
yellow sun recalls Van Gogh's painting of

The Sower (23) of the year before, in which
the disc of the sun became a natural halo

for the figure. Here the disc hovers above a
grove of highly stylised olive trees. At the time
Van Gogh wanted to prove to Gauguin and
Bernard that an expressive work of art could be
made without quoting directly from the Bible.

Olive Grove, Saint-Rémy,
1889

Recent technical analysis has suggested that
Van Gogh painted this olive grove largely
outdoors as natural materials have been

found in its paint layers. It is exceptionally well
preserved in terms of its colour. In other works,
such as Olive Grove with Two Olive Pickers (59)
hanging alongside, Van Gogh experimented
with paints that were new on the market and
which have since faded. For this luminous
picture he used more stable pigments.

Olive Grove with Two Olive
Pickers, 1889

In the studio, Van Gogh repeated the
composition of Olive Grove, Saint-Rémy (58)
to which he added imagined figures, a smiling
woman in the foreground and a man in blue.
Their presence adds to what was already a
highly composed and stylised depiction of

a grove beneath a sky flecked with wisps

of red and blue clouds — all painted using
drifts of brushstrokes.

Tree Trunks in the Grass,
1890

Applying paint in calligraphic strokes
reminiscent of his reed pen drawings, Van
Gogh revels in the textures and colours of this
view of flowering weeds growing among the
trees in the garden at Saint-Rémy. In contrast
to the sadness and suffering he aimed to
convey in depictions of the hospital grounds
the previous autumn, his paintings of the
garden in spring 1890 suggest joy and hope.

Long Grass with Butterflies,
1890

By the spring of 1890 Van Gogh was acting
on plans to leave the South of France and
return north. He was, however, captivated
yet again by signs of burgeoning life, such
as butterflies among the grass and details
of the undergrowth he found in the garden
at Saint-Rémy.
