Introduction

In February 1888, the Dutch artist Vincent
van Gogh (1853-1890) went to live and
work in the South of France. Over the next.
two years, in both Arles and Saint-Rémy- —

de-Provence, he created an extraordinary
and innovative body of work in which he

transformed the people and places he
encountered in life. Parks, landscapes and
corners of nature became highly expressive,
idealised spaces full of literary and poetic ©
references. Similarly, Van Gogh chose ~
individuals from his new surroundings to
create portraits of symbolic types, suctia as”

The Poet or The Lover.

_ The careful planning behind Van Gogh's art.
extended to creating works in groups or series,
and to thinking about how these might be
displayed both at his home in Arles and for
exhibition in Paris. By gathering a selection of

these paintings — many of which are among
his most famous and beloved creations —

and showing them alongside his carefully

developed works on paper, a less familiar Van
Gogh emerges: an intellectual artist of lucid”

intention, deliberation and great ambition.

This first major exhibition devoted to Van -
Gogh in the National Gallery's history is chief
among the events celebrating the Gallery's
bicentenary. It also marks 100 years since the
Gallery purchased the Sunflowers and Van
Gogh's Chair for the Collection.

A brief chronology of Van Gogh’s life, with a
focus on his time in the South of France when
he experienced periods of mental illness, can
be found at the end of this booklet.

The Lover (Portrait of
Lieutenant Milliet), 1888

Milliet’s success with women, about which
Van Gogh was both amused and envious,
made the lieutenant the perfect model for

The Lover. Van Gogh depicts Milliet in the
dashing uniform of the Zouaves — one of the
infantry units linked to North Africa — whose
star and crescent regimental emblem Van
Gogh reverses (for reasons unknown) in the
background. The men became friends in Arles,
with Van Gogh giving Milliet drawing lessons.

The Poet’s Garden (Public
Garden in Arles), 1888

The unremarkable public garden in front of
Van Gogh's home in Arles was the starting
point for many views in which he used
artistic licence and his imagination to create
idealised worlds. He described the site in
which young lovers stand in the shade of a
spreading fir tree as ‘the poet’s garden’ and
imagined it as a place frequented by artists
and writers of the past.

The Poet (Portrait of
Eugene Boch), 1888

Van Gogh had detailed plans for how he
would depict a poet some time before

he found Eugéne Boch (a painter) to be

his model. Van Gogh felt Boch was ideal

as he had a narrow face that reminded him
of the 13th-century poet Dante. The deep
blue sky behind the figure, intended to
express a man ‘who dreams great dreams’,
was essential to the symbolism of the work.

The Garden:
Poetic Interpretations

Van Gogh chose a great variety of

motifs from the public garden in front

of his home in Arles and later within the
confines of the grounds of the hospital of
Saint-Paul de Mausole at Saint-Rémy-de-
Provence. In his paintings and works on
paper, he selected specific viewpoints and
varied his approach to style and use of
colour to explore wide-ranging emotional
and poetic possibilities, often with a
literary or artistic source in mind. In aiming
to convey meaning rather than accurately
record nature, Van Gogh took a free hand
in adjusting or recomposing what he
observed to achieve his desired effects.

The Public Garden, Arles,
1888

Van Gogh repeatedly drew and painted views
of the gardens in Arles over the summer of
1888. On 22 October he wrote to his brother
Theo (1857-1891) to say that, despite
promising himself not to work, he could not
resist painting the park’s autumn colours.
‘But it’s like that every day, sometimes in
passing | find such beautiful things that in
the end you have to try to do them anyway.’

Entrance to the Public
Garden in Arles, 1888

The gardens in Arles inspired contrasting
moods. Van Gogh depicted this view of the
park as an everyday scene. He described

the locals as ‘something out of Daumier
come to life’, a reference to the French artist
famous for his caricatures. There is a comical
edge to figures such as the man in worker's
blue transfixed by his newspaper — possibly
Van Gogh himself — and the squat woman
labouring up the path.

Path in the Park, Arles, 1888

The park in front of the Yellow House,

Van Gogh's home in Arles, was close to the
town’s station. Yet in this view the groups

of colourfully dressed figures moving beneath
the trees appear less like passers-by than
participants in a féte ga/ante, or elegant
outdoor entertainment, as imagined by the
artists Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684-1721)
and Adolphe Monticelli (1824-1886). Van
Gogh admired both artists.

Undergrowth, 1889

Van Gogh became fascinated by the large,
neglected garden of the hospital at Saint-
Rémy, to which he admitted himself in May
1889 after a series of mental breakdowns
in the preceding months. In this innovative
composition, he looks directly down into
the dense undergrowth and ivy that climbs
the nearby trees. The richly textured,
swirling paint evokes the dense vegetation
as well as the dappled light that breaks
into open sunlight at the top of the canvas.

The Garden of the Asylum
at Saint-Remy, 1889

This was one of the first works Van Gogh
painted after arriving at the hospital at Saint-
Rémy. During his first weeks, Van Gogh was
not allowed beyond the hospital garden but
found delight in its overgrown and intimate
corners, which he associated with ‘nests of
greenery for lovers’ — continuing a poetic
theme he had explored in the park in Arles.

These close-up views of shrubs and flowers
were made during Van Gogh’s first weeks at
Saint-Rémy in May-June 1889. His assured,
rapid application of bold dashes, hatching,
dots and swirls capture the different textures
of the vegetation to create richly patterned
surfaces. The works on paper belong to

a small and unique group in diluted paint

in which Van Gogh sought to capture the
vibrancy and profusion of spring growth, as
well his excitement at the artistic possibilities
offered by his new environment.

A Corner of the Garden :
of Saint-Paul’s Hospital
at Saint-Rémy, 1889

Using soft graphite and ink on pinkish paper,
this ambitious drawing is the most finished of
a group Van Gogh made of this corner of the
hospital garden. Above a fence, a row of pines
with irregular, windswept growth shelters

the overgrown grass below, which is dotted
with flowers such as the foreground irises.

The bending gardener or labourer may have
been someone Van Gogh observed, but could
equally have been invented.

The Garden of the Asylum
with Sawn-Off Tree, 1889

By the autumn of 1889, Van Gogh turned
from his initial interpretation of the hospital’s
garden as a ‘nest for lovers’ to seeing it as a
site of suffering. In this drawing, related to
the painted work that hangs alongside (13),
Van Gogh attempted to convey this sense of
anguish via the intensity of his pen strokes.
These capture the dense growth of the pine
trees and the rain puddles on the path.

The Park of the Hospital
at Saint-Remy, 1889

Melancholy permeates this powerful depiction
of the garden at Saint-Rémy, which is dominated
by a sawn-off pine tree that had been struck by
lightning. In a letter to his friend, the painter
Emile Bernard (1868-1941), in November
1889, Van Gogh described the tree as a ‘dark
giant — like a proud man brought low’ and
detailed how he combined composition, colour
and technique to convey the anxiety felt by his
fellow patients at the hospital.

Hospital at Saint-Rémy, 1889

Van Gogh chose a vertical format to give full
height to the massive pine trees that dwarfed
the male wing of the hospital building. The
reddish soil, highly stylised tree trunks and
interlocking branches overhead produce a
vibrant but oppressive environment within
which Van Gogh arranges a number of figures,
including perhaps himself, just left of centre.
The women are an invention; female patients
were not allowed in this part of the grounds.

Trees in the Garden of
the Asylum, 1889

Two curving tree trunks, cropped at the

top and bottom of the picture, frame a view
towards one of the terraced lawns at the
edge of the hospital gardens. Van Gogh
greatly admired and collected Japanese
woodblock prints, in which such dramatic
compositional devices were common. This
work’s graphic quality is counterbalanced by
his choice to paint a densely worked sky.

lris, 1890

Irises grow in profusion in the South of
France and there were many in the garden
at Saint-Rémy. Van Gogh isolated this single
plant, just coming into full bloom, almost
as if he were painting a portrait. He used
cardboard as a support as he was running
short of canvas at the time.

Roses, 1889

Van Gogh’s attention was caught by the
profusion of pink blooms on this rose bush

in the overgrown garden at Saint-Rémy.
Manipulating thickly applied paint with a
wide variety of brushstrokes, from the swirling
to the spiky, he captures the differing textures
of the soft rose petals amid the surrounding
grasses, flowers, shrubs and weeds.

Park at Arles with a Corner
of the Yellow House, 1888

Van Gogh drew this meandering path in the
park at Arles shortly after he began renting

the Yellow House in May 1888. A corner of
the house can be glimpsed in the upper right.
Van Gogh felt he could probably have found

a better place to rent, but wrote ‘the delightful
thing about this studio is the gardens opposite’.

Garden with Weeping Tree,
Arles, 1888

Diagonal stripes of hay wilting on a newly
mown lawn create an almost abstract pattern
in this extraordinary view onto a small patch of
the public gardens at Arles. A great variety

of marks evoke cut grass, shadows, foliage
and gravel. This drawing was made after an
oil painting that Van Gogh hailed as a ‘new
subject’. In this and other works on paper he
explored the subject further, aiming for more
‘clarity of touch’.

Weeping Tree, 1889

‘Today I've made one of those drawings which
became very dark and quite melancholic for
springtime’, Van Gogh wrote to his brother in
May 1889. Depicting the same tree and round
bush he had often captured in drawings the
previous year (18 and 19), Van Gogh created
an entirely different composition. He also
made more vigorous use of one of his own
hand-cut reed pens and other media to give
the work its emotional charge.
