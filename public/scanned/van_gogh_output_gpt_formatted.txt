## Room 1: Introduction

In February 1888, the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) went to live and work in the South of France. Over the next two years, in both Arles and Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, he created an extraordinary and innovative body of work in which he transformed the people and places he encountered in life. Parks, landscapes, and corners of nature became highly expressive, idealised spaces full of literary and poetic references. Similarly, Van Gogh chose individuals from his new surroundings to create portraits of symbolic types, such as *The Poet* or *The Lover*.

The careful planning behind Van Gogh's art extended to creating works in groups or series and to thinking about how these might be displayed both at his home in Arles and for exhibitions in Paris. By gathering a selection of these paintings—many of which are among his most famous and beloved creations—and showing them alongside his carefully developed works on paper, a less familiar Van Gogh emerges: an intellectual artist of lucid intention, deliberation, and great ambition.

This first major exhibition devoted to Van Gogh in the National Gallery's history is chief among the events celebrating the Gallery's bicentenary. It also marks 100 years since the Gallery purchased *Sunflowers* and *Van Gogh's Chair* for the collection.

A brief chronology of Van Gogh's life, with a focus on his time in the South of France when he experienced periods of mental illness, can be found at the end of this booklet.


1. **The Lover (Portrait of Lieutenant Milliet)**, 1888  
   Milliet's success with women, about which Van Gogh was both amused and envious, made the lieutenant the perfect model for *The Lover*. Van Gogh depicts Milliet in the dashing uniform of the Zouaves—one of the infantry units linked to North Africa—whose star and crescent regimental emblem Van Gogh reverses (for reasons unknown) in the background. The men became friends in Arles, with Van Gogh giving Milliet drawing lessons.  
   *Oil on canvas, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, The Netherlands*

2. **The Poet's Garden (Public Garden in Arles)**, 1888  
   The unremarkable public garden in front of Van Gogh's home in Arles was the starting point for many views in which he used artistic license and his imagination to create idealized worlds. He described the site in which young lovers stand in the shade of a spreading fir tree as *'the poet's garden'* and imagined it as a place frequented by artists and writers of the past.  
   *Oil on canvas, Private collection*

3. **The Poet (Portrait of Eugène Boch)**, 1888  
   Van Gogh had detailed plans for how he would depict a poet some time before he found Eugène Boch (a painter) to be his model. Van Gogh felt Boch was ideal as he had a narrow face that reminded him of the 13th-century poet Dante. The deep blue sky behind the figure, intended to express a man *'who dreams great dreams'*, was essential to the symbolism of the work.  
   *Oil on canvas, Musée d'Orsay, Paris, bequest of Eugène Boch, 1941*

## Room 2: The Garden: Poetic Interpretations

Van Gogh chose a great variety of motifs from the public garden in front of his home in Arles and later within the confines of the grounds of the hospital of Saint-Paul de Mausole at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. In his paintings and works on paper, he selected specific viewpoints and varied his approach to style and use of colour to explore wide-ranging emotional and poetic possibilities, often with a literary or artistic source in mind. In aiming to convey meaning rather than accurately record nature, Van Gogh took a free hand in adjusting or recomposing what he observed to achieve his desired effects.

4. **The Public Garden, Arles**, 1888  
Van Gogh repeatedly drew and painted views of the gardens in Arles over the summer of 1888. On 22 October, he wrote to his brother Theo (1857-1891) to say that, despite promising himself not to work, he could not resist painting the park’s autumn colours. *‘But it’s like that every day; sometimes, in passing, I find such beautiful things that, in the end, you have to try to do them anyway.’*  
*Oil on canvas, Private Collection*

5. **Entrance to the Public Garden in Arles**, 1888  
The gardens in Arles inspired contrasting moods. Van Gogh depicted this view of the park as an everyday scene. He described the locals as *‘something out of Daumier come to life’*, a reference to the French artist famous for his caricatures. There is a comical edge to figures such as the man in worker’s blue transfixed by his newspaper—possibly Van Gogh himself—and the squat woman laboring up the path.  
*Oil on canvas, The Phillips Collection, Washington, DC. Acquired 1930*

6. **Path in the Park, Arles**, 1888  
The park in front of the Yellow House, Van Gogh's home in Arles, was close to the town’s station. Yet in this view, the groups of colourfully dressed figures moving beneath the trees appear less like passers-by than participants in a *fête galante*, or elegant outdoor entertainment, as imagined by the artists Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684-1721) and Adolphe Monticelli (1824-1886). Van Gogh admired both artists.  
*Oil on canvas, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, The Netherlands*

7. **Undergrowth**, 1889  
Van Gogh became fascinated by the large, neglected garden of the hospital at Saint-Rémy, to which he admitted himself in May 1889 after a series of mental breakdowns in the preceding months. In this innovative composition, he looks directly down into the dense undergrowth and ivy that climbs the nearby trees. The richly textured, swirling paint evokes the dense vegetation as well as the dappled light that breaks into open sunlight at the top of the canvas.  
*Oil on canvas, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (Vincent van Gogh Foundation)*

8. **The Garden of the Asylum at Saint-Rémy**, 1889  
This was one of the first works Van Gogh painted after arriving at the hospital at Saint-Rémy. During his first weeks, Van Gogh was not allowed beyond the hospital garden but found delight in its overgrown and intimate corners, which he associated with *‘nests of greenery for lovers’*—continuing a poetic theme he had explored in the park in Arles.  
*Oil on canvas, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, The Netherlands*

9. **The Courtyard of the Saint-Paul Cloister in Saint-Rémy**  
Fotocollectie Van de Poll © Dutch National Archives, 2.24.14.02 / 252-1828

10. **Flowering Shrubs**, 1889  
Chalk, brush, diluted oil paint, and pencil on paper, Colección Pérez Simón, Mexico

11. **A Corner of the Garden of Saint-Paul's Hospital at Saint-Rémy**, 1889  
Using soft graphite and ink on pinkish paper, this ambitious drawing is the most finished of a group Van Gogh made of this corner of the hospital garden. Above a fence, a row of pines with irregular, windswept growth shelters the overgrown grass below, which is dotted with flowers such as the foreground irises. The bending gardener or laborer may have been someone Van Gogh observed but equally could have been invented.  
*Graphite and ink on paper, Tate: Bequeathed by C. Frank Stoop 1933*

12. **The Garden of the Asylum with Sawn-Off Tree**, 1889  
By the autumn of 1889, Van Gogh turned from his initial interpretation of the hospital's garden as a *‘nest for lovers’* to seeing it as a site of suffering. In this drawing, related to the painted work that hangs alongside (13), Van Gogh attempted to convey this sense of anguish via the intensity of his pen strokes. These capture the dense growth of the pine trees and the rain puddles on the path.  
*Black chalk, quill and reed pen and brown ink on paper, Private Collection*

13. **The Park of the Hospital at Saint-Rémy**, 1889  
Melancholy permeates this powerful depiction of the garden at Saint-Rémy, which is dominated by a sawn-off pine tree that had been struck by lightning. In a letter to his friend, the painter Emile Bernard (1868-1941), in November 1889, Van Gogh described the tree as a *‘dark giant—like a proud man brought low’* and detailed how he combined composition, colour, and technique to convey the anxiety felt by his fellow patients at the hospital.  
*Oil on canvas, Museum Folkwang, Essen*

14. **Hospital at Saint-Rémy**, 1889  
Van Gogh chose a vertical format to give full height to the massive pine trees that dwarfed the male wing of the hospital building. The reddish soil, highly stylised tree trunks, and interlocking branches overhead produce a vibrant but oppressive environment within which Van Gogh arranges a number of figures, including perhaps himself, just left of centre. The women are an invention; female patients were not allowed in this part of the grounds.  
*Oil on canvas, Hammer Foundation, Hammer Museum, Los Angeles*

15. **Trees in the Garden of the Asylum**, 1889  
Two curving tree trunks, cropped at the top and bottom of the picture, frame a view towards one of the terraced lawns at the edge of the hospital gardens. Van Gogh greatly admired and collected Japanese woodblock prints, in which such dramatic compositional devices were common. This work's graphic quality is counterbalanced by his choice to paint a densely worked sky.  
*Oil on canvas, Private Collection*

16. **Iris**, 1890  
Irises grow in profusion in the South of France and there were many in the garden at Saint-Rémy. Van Gogh isolated this single plant, just coming into full bloom, almost as if he were painting a portrait. He used cardboard as a support as he was running short of canvas at the time.  
*Oil on cardboard, later thinned and mounted on canvas, National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa. Purchased 1954*

17. **Roses**, 1889  
Van Gogh's attention was caught by the profusion of pink blooms on this rose bush in the overgrown garden at Saint-Rémy. Manipulating thickly applied paint with a wide variety of brushstrokes, from the swirling to the spiky, he captures the differing textures of the soft rose petals amid the surrounding grasses, flowers, shrubs, and weeds.  
*Oil on canvas, The National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo. Matsukata Collection*

18. **Park at Arles with a Corner of the Yellow House**, 1888  
Van Gogh drew this meandering path in the park at Arles shortly after he began renting the Yellow House in May 1888. A corner of the house can be glimpsed in the upper right. Van Gogh felt he could probably have found a better place to rent, but wrote *‘the delightful thing about this studio is the gardens opposite’*.  
*Quill and reed pen and brown ink on paper, Private Collection*

19. **Garden with Weeping Tree, Arles**, 1888  
Diagonal stripes of hay wilting on a newly mown lawn create an almost abstract pattern in this extraordinary view onto a small patch of the public gardens at Arles. A great variety of marks evoke cut grass, shadows, foliage, and gravel. This drawing was made after an oil painting that Van Gogh hailed as a *‘new subject’*. In this and other works on paper, he explored the subject further, aiming for more *‘clarity of touch’*.  
*Ink with traces of graphite on paper, The Menil Collection, Houston*

20. **Weeping Tree**, 1889  
*‘Today I've made one of those drawings which became very dark and quite melancholic for springtime’*, Van Gogh wrote to his brother in May 1889. Depicting the same tree and round bush he had often captured in drawings the previous year (18 and 19), Van Gogh created an entirely different composition. He also made more vigorous use of one of his own hand-cut reed pens and other media to give the work its emotional charge.  
*Reed pen and black-brown ink, with black chalk on off-white wove paper, The Art Institute of Chicago, Gift of Tiffany and Margaret Blake, 1945.31*

## Room 3: The Yellow House: An Artist's Home

Initially, Van Gogh used the Yellow House, which he rented in early May 1888, only as a studio because it needed both renovation and furniture. By September, he moved in and had bold plans to turn the modest house into an *‘artist’s home’* and a communal *‘studio of the South’* in which his artist friends from Paris could join him to work. He devised a decoration for the house that included his major paintings, evolving carefully conceived ideas about how to present his art to the public. The works in this gallery were part of these ambitions.

### Featured Works

21. **Van Gogh's Chair**, 1888  
   A rustic chair on which Van Gogh has placed his pipe and tobacco stands as the artist's surrogate self-portrait, while the terracotta tiles and limewashed walls give a glimpse of the Yellow House’s simple interior. Painted in late 1888, when the painter Paul Gauguin (1848-1903) had come to stay in Arles, it is one of a pair—the other flatteringly representing Gauguin via an armchair with two novels and a candle on its seat.  
   *Oil on canvas, The National Gallery, London. Bought, Courtauld Fund, 1924*

22. **Starry Night over the Rhône**, 1888  
   *‘The starry sky at last, actually painted at night, under a gas-lamp’* was how Van Gogh described this view of Arles from across the River Rhône. Despite painting it largely outdoors and in real time, he made compositional choices to achieve his desired effect by positioning the constellation of Ursa Major above the scene and inventing the foreground lovers. Their presence was essential to his conception of the picture’s status as a *‘poetic subject’*.  
   *Oil on canvas, Musée d'Orsay, Paris, Donation of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Kahn-Sriber, in memory of Mr. and Mrs. Fernand Moch, 1975*

23. **The Sower**, 1888  
   By the artist's estimation, this depiction of a sower silhouetted against an enormous sun was among his most important works from Arles. Mostly working in the studio, he fused motifs from other artists and Japanese prints with his own observations of nature. By placing the huge disc of the sun behind the figure of the sower, he created a powerfully expressive image with symbolic content and Christian overtones.  
   *Oil on canvas, Sammlung Emil Biuhrle, on long-term loan at Kunsthaus Zurich*

## Room 4: Montmajour: A Series

Van Gogh marvelled at the landscapes surrounding Arles, some of which reminded him of places mentioned in his favourite novels. Among the most evocative were the grounds surrounding the ruined 12th-century Montmajour Abbey, a well-known landmark north of Arles. After making a number of drawings of Montmajour in May 1888, he returned in July to create a series of large-scale works on paper. These remarkable drawings depict a hybrid place; at once the result of meticulous observation and the artist’s imagination.

### Featured Works

29. **View of Arles from Montmajour**, 1888  
   The distinctive skyline of Arles, with the smoking chimneys of the town’s factories on the far left, was recorded by Van Gogh as he stood on the heights of Montmajour Abbey. He described the scene to his brother as a contrast between *‘the wild and romantic foreground — and the broad, tranquil distant prospects with their horizontal lines.’* He considered it the first image in a series he dedicated to the site.  
   *Reed and quill pen, ink and pencil on paper, The National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, Oslo*

30. **Trees, Montmajour**, 1888  
   In July 1888, Van Gogh returned to the rough and rocky grounds of Montmajour in the company of Lieutenant Milliet. The terrain strongly reminded the artist of the abandoned garden *‘Le Paradou’*, which featured in Emile Zola’s novel *The Sin of Abbé Mouret* (1875). The importance of the Montmajour drawings to Van Gogh was reflected in his choice of large-format Whatman paper.  
   *Pen, reed pen on wove paper, Collection du Musée des Beaux-Arts, Tournai*  

31. **The Rock of Montmajour with Pine Trees**, 1888  
   Montmajour’s rocky outcrops, with small pine trees and shrubs clinging wherever they could, inspired some of the best reed-pen drawings of Van Gogh's career. In this dramatic view, he includes an obscured glimpse of Arles on the far left. In Zola’s novel, the Abbé, who has forgotten his vows of chastity due to amnesia, occupies the wild paradise of Le Paradou with his lover, distanced from the realities of daily life.  
   *Pencil, pen, reed pen, brush and black ink on wove paper, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (Vincent van Gogh Foundation)*

## Room 5: Decoration

Van Gogh developed his decoration of the Yellow House into a concept for the presentation of his work that could stand alongside the paintings of his contemporaries, and even be transferred for exhibition in Paris. Throughout his time in Provence, he dispatched his work to his brother in the capital and submitted pictures to exhibitions in Paris and Brussels. 

After Van Gogh's first mental breakdown at the end of 1888, and subsequent crises in the following spring, during which time he lost possession of the Yellow House, he continued developing his ideas for decoration. One of his most famous groupings, devised during the spring of 1889 when he was in Saint-Rémy, is recreated in this room: two *Sunflower* pictures flanking *La Berceuse*.

### Featured Works

35. **The Stevedores**, 1888  
   *‘I saw a magnificent and very strange effect this evening. A very large boat laden with coal on the Rhône, moored at the quay... . On the boat, small workmen... were coming and going, carrying the cargo ashore. It was pure Hokusai.’* Van Gogh's description reminds us of the celebrated Japanese printmaker and led to this remarkable picture. The sunset is captured in orange, yellow, and turquoise streaked with lilac.  
   *Oil on canvas, Private Collection*

36. **The Trinquetaille Bridge**, 1888  
   At Arles, a modern bridge crossed the Rhône to connect the old town with the new Trinquetaille quarter. As in *The Stevedores*, Van Gogh explored the expressive potential of using an observed, modern-life subject. The plunging perspective and exaggerated colours, including the river and sky being *‘the colour of absinthe’*, had a particular aim that he outlined in a letter to his brother: *‘I'm attempting something more heartbroken and therefore more heartbreaking.’*  
   *Oil on canvas, Courtesy of Wynn Fine Art*

37. **The Courtyard of the Hospital at Arles**, 1889  
   In the spring of 1889, Van Gogh spent extended time in the hospital in Arles, where he was given a room as a studio. He painted when well enough and sought ways to imbue observed details with emotion. *‘So it’s a painting chock-full of flowers and springtime greenery,’* he wrote to his sister Willemien. *‘However, three black, sad tree-trunks cross it like snakes, and in the foreground four large sad, dark box bushes.’*  
   *Oil on canvas, The Swiss Confederation, Federal Office of Culture, Oskar Reinhart Collection ‘Am Romerholz’, Winterthur*

## Room 6: Variations on a Theme

The landscape surrounding Saint-Rémy, with its olive groves and the craggy limestone of the Alpilles mountain range, provided Van Gogh with rich material for creating series works. Developing ideas established in Arles, he fixed on subjects and explored their expressive possibilities through variations.

At times, he imaginatively pitched his own work against that produced by Gauguin and Bernard. Van Gogh often created his work in the studio, a room provided for him at the hospital, leading him to produce some of the most stylised art of his career.

### Featured Works

47. **The Arlésienne**, 1890  
   *Oil on canvas, Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Moderna e Contemporanea, Rome*

48. **The Arlésienne**, 1890  
   *Oil on canvas, Private Collection*

In popular culture of the time, the women of Arles were celebrated for their raven-haired beauty. Van Gogh painted five versions of this *Arlésienne* (woman from Arles). The model, Marie Ginoux (1848-1911), who ran the local café, had originally posed for Van Gogh and Gauguin in November 1888. Later, in Saint-Rémy, Van Gogh based his quintessential Provencale on a simplified drawing Gauguin made during the sitting, adding two of his favourite books: Charles Dickens's *Christmas Stories* (1843-48) and Harriet Beecher Stowe’s *Uncle Tom's Cabin* (1852). In a letter to Gauguin, Van Gogh called the image *‘a synthesis of an Arlésienne.’* He presented one (47) to his friend Emile Bernard, one to Theo, and another to Gauguin himself, thus ensuring the paintings would be seen by artists in Paris.

49. **A Wheatfield, with Cypresses**, 1889  
   With swirling and rippling strokes of paint, Van Gogh captures the summer mistral wind sweeping through a landscape at the foot of the Alpilles mountains. He had first painted this view outdoors in late June 1889. However, in this studio version from September, he stylised the sky to create a decorative pattern echoing the mountains, cypresses, and vegetation below.
