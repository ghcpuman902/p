The Yellow House:
An Artist's Home

Initially Van Gogh only used the Yellow
House, which he rented in early May
1888, as a studio because It needed both
renovation and furniture. By September
he moved in and had bold plans to turn
the modest house into an ‘artist's home’
and a communal ‘studio of the South’ in
which his artist friends from Paris could
join him to work. He devised a decoration
for the house that included his major
paintings. This then evolved into carefully
conceived ideas about how to present his
art to the public. The works in this gallery
were part of his ambitions.

Van Gogh's Chair, 1888

A rustic chair on which Van Gogh has placed
his pipe and tobacco stands as the artist's
surrogate self portrait, while the terracotta
tiles and limewashed walls give a glimpse of
the Yellow House’s simple interior. Painted
in late 1888, when the painter Paul Gauguin
(1848-1903) had come to stay in Arles,

it is one of a pair — the other flatteringly
representing Gauguin via an armchair

with two novels and a candle on its seat.

Starry Night over the Rhone,
1888

‘The starry sky at last, actually painted at
night, under a gas-lamp’ was how Van
Gogh described this view of Arles from
across the River Rhéne. Despite painting it
largely outdoors and in real time, he made
compositional choices to achieve the effect
he was after by positioning the constellation
of Ursa Major above the scene and inventing
the foreground lovers. Their presence was
essential to his conception of the picture's
status as a ‘poetic subject’.

The Sower, 1888

By the artist's estimation, this depiction of a
sower silhouetted against an enormous sun was
among his most important works from Arles.
Mostly working in the studio, he fused motifs
from other artists and Japanese prints with his
own observations of nature. By placing the
huge disc of the sun behind the figure of the
sower, he created a powerfully expressive image
with symbolic content and Christian overtones.

The Yellow House
(The Street), 1888

The Yellow House, with its bright green shutters
and door, forms part of an urban view of Arles,
which includes a steam train passing over a
bridge and mounds of earth for roadworks.

Van Gogh was proud to have a home and
studio of his own in Arles, and was enamoured
by the vibrant palette of colours the Provencal
light, weather and even building materials
allowed him to explore.

The Bedroom, 1889

The decoration of the Yellow House included
Van Gogh's bedroom. This picture, the second
of three versions, was painted in Saint-Rémy in
September 1889 and shows him imaginatively
changing the display of art on the walls. Over
the bed he replaced The Poet (3), visible in the
first version, with a recent self portrait (26), and
swapped The Lover (1), which hung alongside,
with an unidentified portrait of a woman.

His choice of images perhaps expressed his
yearning for love and companionship.

Self Portrait, 1889

Holding up his palette and brushes, Van Gogh
reaffirms his identity as an artist. He painted
the work ‘on the first day | got up’ following

a long recovery from the mental breakdown
he experienced in July/August 1889. Although
noting that he was ‘thin’ and ‘pale as the
devil’, he was pleased with the contrast of
blue with his ‘whitish’ face and ‘yellow hair’.
The image appeared in his imagined display
of paintings in The Bedroom (25) shortly after.

The Alyscamps, 1888

The colour of the autumn trees in a lane lined
with old Roman and medieval sarcophagi
captivated Van Gogh and prompted this

view of Arles, in which he imagined a pair of
lovers taking a promenade. It also provided a
perfect balancing of opposites, which the artist
felt created harmony in a picture. Here the
remnants of the ancient world are contrasted
with modern factories glimpsed between the
trees, while young lovers walk among the dead.

The Green Vineyard, 1888

Painted mostly outdoors, this landscape is
remarkable for its impasto (thickly applied
paint) and rich colour. Van Gogh probably
finished it in the studio, complaining to Theo
that he sweated blood and tears over it. He
was pleased with the finished result, however,
and listed it among his ‘poetic subjects’,
which included Starry Night over the Rhéne
(22) and a picture on the theme of The Poet's
Garden, all intended as decorations for the
Yellow House.

Montmajour:
A Series

Van Gogh marvelled at the landscapes
surrounding Arles, some of which put him
in mind of places mentioned in his favourite
novels. Among the most evocative were
the grounds surrounding the ruined 12th-
century Montmajour Abbey, a well-known
landmark north of Arles. After making a
number of drawings of Montmajour in

May 1888, he returned in July to create a
series of large-scale works on paper. These
remarkable drawings depict a hybrid place;
at once the result of meticulous observation
and the artist’s imagination.

View of Arles from
Montmajour, 1888

The distinctive skyline of Arles, with the
smoking chimneys of the town’s factories

on the far left, was recorded by Van Gogh

as he stood on the heights of Montmajour
Abbey. He described the scene to his brother
as a contrast between ‘the wild and romantic
foreground — and the broad, tranquil distant
prospects with their horizontal lines’. He
considered it the first image in a series

he dedicated to the site.

Trees, Montmajour, 1888

In July 1888 Van Gogh returned to the
rough and rocky grounds of Montmajour in
the company of Lieutenant Milliet (1). The
terrain put the artist strongly in mind of the
abandoned garden ‘Le Paradou’ (a Provencal
word for ‘Paradise’), which featured in Emile
Zola’s novel The Sin of Abbé Mouret (1875).
The importance of the Montmajour drawings
to Van Gogh was reflected in his choice of
large-format Whatman paper.

The Rock of Montmajour
with Pine Trees, 1888

Montmajour’s rocky outcrops, with small pine
trees and shrubs clinging wherever they could,
inspired some of ‘the best’ reed-pen drawings
of Van Gogh’'s career. In this dramatic view,
he includes an obscured glimpse of Arles on
the far left. In Zola’s novel, the Abbé, who has
forgotten his vows of chastity due to amnesia,
occupies the wild paradise of Le Paradou

with his lover, distanced from the realities

of daily life.

Hill with the Ruins of
Montmajour, 1888

In this extremely bold composition, the ruined
abbey is dwarfed by an enormous foreground
rock. Van Gogh told Theo he had journeyed to
Montmajour 50 times and remained enamoured
despite the heat, the fierce mistral wind and the
mosquitoes. ‘If a view makes one forget those
little vexations, there must be something in it.’

View of La Crau from
Montmajour, 1888

Van Gogh contrasts a steam train with

a horse-drawn carriage in this sweeping
panorama across the plain of La Crau. The
vista recalls the pivotal scene in Zola’s The Sin
of Abbé Mouret when the priest's amnesia

lifts as he sees the landscape below Le Paradou
dotted with people living ordinary lives. Van
Gogh considered this the last drawing of the
Montmajour series and among ‘the best I’ve
done with my pen’.

A Trunk of a Tree, 1888

Using the top edge of the paper to crop

this virtuoso depiction of a tree, Van Gogh
adopts the bold compositional devices found
in Japanese woodblock prints. He had been
collecting such prints during his time in Paris,
and greatly admired the Japanese approach
to drawing and mark-making in translating
the natural world onto paper.
